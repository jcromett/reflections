How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug 
that was introduced?

The use of + and - lines makes it very easy to identify what has changed from 
one version to the next.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

Confidence to know that I can always find old versions and ease in tracking 
down what has changed.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
 commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like 
 Google Docs does?

Cons: Might forget. Sometimes hard to know how to chunk commits.
Pros: Can organize so that code is chunked in meaningful blocks for future 
reference.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file
separately?

Some systems are designed to support more complex scenarios, such as are found
in sofware development

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

You always can revert back to an earlier version
